# فصل چهار: «سرقت» (piracy)

از زمانی که قانون شروع به تنظیم و کنترل مالکیت آفرینشی کرده است، همواره جنگی بر علیه «سرقت» در جریان بوده است. ترسیم شکل دقیق این دغدغه، یعنی «سرقت» دشوار است اما نمایش بی‌عدالتی‌اش به سادگی قابل ضبط است. لرد هنسفیلد در ارتباط با موردی که در آن، قانون حق نشر انگلیس به نت‌های موسیقی تسری داده شده بود نوشته است:

> یک شخص می‌تواند با نواختن یک قطعه، آن را تکثیر کند اما او حق ندارد با تکثیر و نگهداری آن‌ها برای خودش،‌ سود صاحب اثر را بدزدد.[1]

امروز ما در میانه‌ی «جنگ» دیگری بر ضد «سرقت» هستیم. اینترنت آتش این جنگ را افروخته است. اینترنت، گسترش کارای محتوا را ممکن می‌سازد. انتقال فایل همتا (Peer-to-peer یا p2p) یکی از کاراترین فناوری‌های کارایی است که اینترنت فراهم آورده است. سامانه‌های p2p با استفاده از هوش توزیع‌شده، نشر آسان محتوا را آن‌چنان تسهیل می‌کنند که یک نسل پیش قابل تصور نبود.

این کارایی، خطوط حق‌نشر سنتی را محترم نمی‌شمرد. شبکه، میان به اشتراک‌گذاری محتوای دارای حق‌نشر و محتوای فاقد آن تبعیضی نمی‌گذارد. در نتیجه، حجم بالایی از محتوای مشمول حق‌نشر، به اشتراک گذاشته می‌شوند. این امر، بر آتش جنگ می‌افزاید؛ چرا که دارندگان حق‌نشر نگران آن هستند که «سود مؤلف با تاراج برود».



The warriors have turned to the courts, to the legislatures, and increasingly to technology to defend their "property" against this "piracy." A generation of Americans, the warriors warn, is being raised to believe that "property" should be "free." Forget tattoos, never mind body piercing--our kids are becoming thieves!

There's no doubt that "piracy" is wrong, and that pirates should be punished. But before we summon the executioners, we should put this notion of "piracy" in some context. For as the concept is increasingly used, at its core is an extraordinary idea that is almost certainly wrong.

The idea goes something like this:

> Creative work has value; whenever I use, or take, or build upon the creative work of others, I am taking from them something of value. Whenever I take something of value from someone else, I should have their permission. The taking of something of value from someone else without permission is wrong. It is a form of piracy.

This view runs deep within the current debates. It is what NYU law professor Rochelle Dreyfuss criticizes as the "if value, then right" theory of creative property[2] --if there is value, then someone must have a right to that value. It is the perspective that led a composers' rights organization, ASCAP, to sue the Girl Scouts for failing to pay for the songs that girls sang around Girl Scout campfires.[3] There was "value" (the songs) so there must have been a "right"--even against the Girl Scouts.

This idea is certainly a possible understanding of how creative property should work. It might well be a possible design for a system of law protecting creative property. But the "if value, then right" theory of creative property has never been America's theory of creative property. It has never taken hold within our law.

Instead, in our tradition, intellectual property is an instrument. It sets the groundwork for a richly creative society but remains subservient to the value of creativity. The current debate has this turned around. We have become so concerned with protecting the instrument that we are losing sight of the value.

The source of this confusion is a distinction that the law no longer takes care to draw--the distinction between republishing someone's work on the one hand and building upon or transforming that work on the other. Copyright law at its birth had only publishing as its concern; copyright law today regulates both.

Before the technologies of the Internet, this conflation didn't matter all that much. The technologies of publishing were expensive; that meant the vast majority of publishing was commercial. Commercial entities could bear the burden of the law--even the burden of the Byzantine complexity that copyright law has become. It was just one more expense of doing business.

But with the birth of the Internet, this natural limit to the reach of the law has disappeared. The law controls not just the creativity of commercial creators but effectively that of anyone. Although that expansion would not matter much if copyright law regulated only "copying," when the law regulates as broadly and obscurely as it does, the extension matters a lot. The burden of this law now vastly outweighs any original benefit--certainly as it affects noncommercial creativity, and increasingly as it affects commercial creativity as well. Thus, as we'll see more clearly in the chapters below, the law's role is less and less to support creativity, and more and more to protect certain industries against competition. Just at the time digital technology could unleash an extraordinary range of commercial and noncommercial creativity, the law burdens this creativity with insanely complex and vague rules and with the threat of obscenely severe penalties. We may be seeing, as Richard Florida writes, the "Rise of the Creative Class."[4] Unfortunately, we are also seeing an extraordinary rise of regulation of this creative class.

These burdens make no sense in our tradition. We should begin by understanding that tradition a bit more and by placing in their proper context the current battles about behavior labeled "piracy."

[4] In The Rise of the Creative Class (New York: Basic Books, 2002), Richard Florida documents a shift in the nature of labor toward a labor of creativity. His work, however, doesn't directly address the legal conditions under which that creativity is enabled or stifled. I certainly agree with him about the importance and significance of this change, but I also believe the conditions under which it will be enabled are much more tenuous.
