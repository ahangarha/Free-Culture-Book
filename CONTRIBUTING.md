# What to contribute?

## Mismatch report/correction as compared to the original book

Since the English version of the book on this repository is copied from some other sources and is not made directly from the book itself, there might be mismatch in it. In this regard, any contribution in the following list would be highly appriciated (as compared to the original book):
- Typo
- Wrong reference
- Wrong order or formatting
- Missing content

## Translation

The initial objective of making this repository was to provide an environment to ease the cooperation for translating the book into other languages. If you are eager to make the book accessable for non-English speaking people, you are in the right place.

For translation you need to make an exact copy of the English version (EN directory) to your desired language, rename the folder to the standard codename and start your work. Just make sure you translate the text and not alter the structure, including the references withing the text. If somepart of the text is not easy to translate for you, leave it as it is. It is better to not have translation than having totally wrong and meaningless translation.

## Graphic
If you are into graphic design, This project has the following needs:
- Book Cover for different languages
- Rasterized graphic of the visual contents of the book

Please provide the designs under free licences (we suggest Creative Commons licences) and in an open format (such as SVG).
